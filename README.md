This a project done as part of my University's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP), titled 'UROP: Telegram chatbot for novice programmers to learn coding', supervised and initiated by Professor Oka Kurniawan ([here](https://github.com/kurniawano) is his Github account), spanding 8 months of (on-off) work.

Here is the description of the UROP project:
'''
Learning coding can be improved significantly when learners have an immediate and personalized feedback. The number of learners for coding make it impossible for human instructors to give an immediate and personalized feedback to learners. The rise of AI gives us the possibility to create a chatbot Tutor that can support learners anywhere and at any time. The purpose of this project is to create a Telegram chatbot where learners can get feedback related to their coding courses. The feedback should be accurate as reflected in the notes or instructor problem set.

The chatbot can be used for any institution that teaches programming.
